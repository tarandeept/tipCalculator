## Notes

This was my first time using xcode and swift so it was a challenge to learn how to navigate through xcode and how to build a UI.
It took me a lot of time to figure out how to correctly implement the settings screen and have the default tip amount on the settings screen synchronize with the tip amount on the main screen.
This was also my first time using git. I made many mistakes trying to push my local respository to github so I had to restart this process several times. I did however learn a lot about git and how to correctly push projects to github.
Overall I learned a lot from completing this project and I can't wait to learn more!
